                    Re-Boot is a non-profit making product exchange portal that provides a secure hub for the recyling
                    of good quality rugby boots. The website targets the rugby playing community through keeping the
                    cost of participation to an inexpensive level . Furthermore, a reduced carbon footprint can be
                    achieved through avoiding the purchase of brand new rugby boots and move to reuse to reduce unecessary waste.

                    Once you've registered as a ReBoot member you will have full access to our BootShop that caters for
                    both junior and adult sized rugby boots. Pricing is kept very simple as we only charge £5.00 for junior
                    boots and £10.00 for adult boots. Whilst we cannot guarantee all sizes for all of our members, our current
                    stock is built from our members generous free donation of unwanted boots. This helps create the Reboot BootShop. All Proceeds
                    from sales go towards the maintenance of the ReBoot website and cost of packaging of sending purchased boots.
